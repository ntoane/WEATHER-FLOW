*The Deep Learning pipeline for weather prediction, developed as an experimental platform for the UCT Cognitive Systems Lab, incorporates temporal and spatio-temporal deep learning models. This pipeline aims to facilitate experimentation and integration of the latest and most cutting-edge ST-GNN (Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Network) models for weather forecasting.*

# Requirements

python3

See `requirements_all.txt`

# Installation

* First create a new virtual environment by running the following command:

'python3.8 -m venv myenv'

* Activate the virtual environment.
* The activation command varies depending on your operating system:
* On Windows

'myenv\Scripts\activate'

* On Linux or Mac OS X

'source myenv/bin/activate'

* Install all necessary dependencies and modules in requirements_all.txt

'pip3 install -r requirements_all.txt'

# Experiments:

*Only use the following command for all training, HPO and evaluation experiments with the models. Change the default configuration in the config.yaml file for the intended option of either training or performing HPO or evaluating the models to true.*

python3 main.py --mode config.yaml

### More details on Training, performing HPO and evaluating Models

***Training Models Using Optimal Hyper-Parameters***

For TCN:
Baseline training across 45 weather stations on [3, 6, 9, 12, 24] hour forecasting horizon.

For GWN:
GWN GNN HPO on [3, 6, 9, 12, 24] hour forecasting horizon.

***Performing Random-Search Hyper-Parameter Optimisation(HPO)***

For TCN:
Baseline HPO across 45 weather stations on 24 hour forecasting horizon.

For GWN:
GWN GNN HPO on 24 hour forecasting horizon.

***Evaluating Models' Performance(MSE, RMSE, MAE, SMAPE)***

For TCN:
Evaluation across 21 weather stations on [3, 6, 9, 12, 24] hour forecasting horizon.

For GWN:
GWN GNN HPO on [3, 6, 9, 12, 24] hour forecasting horizon on each of the 21 weather stations:
